Home Automation using Machine Learning:
Make an energy effecient lighting system for places such as lobbies and corridors such that energy at each point is above a minimum threshold, wasting minimum energy. A human analogous model was designed using the neural network algorithm. 

Approach:
The network learns the pattern of bulbs in the lobby according to the intensity values obtained by ldr sensors placed at various points and the atmospheric conditions. Accordingly the trained network gives the battern of bulbs according to the atmospheric condition such that energy at each point is approximately equal to the threshold.

Installations required:
1. Python 3.6: https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. Numpy
3. PLX-DAQ: Save data obtained by LDR sensors as excel file.
